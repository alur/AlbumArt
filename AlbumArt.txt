AlbumArt 1.7 by Alurcard2

AlbumArt is intended to get cover art for the currently playing Winamp (or
foobar) song. No other audio players are supported at this time.

Note that if you plan to use this module with foobar you'll need a Winamp 
emulation plugin that supports IPC_GET_PLAYING_FILENAME. I'd recommend 
foo_vis_shpeck (http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=59388).
It is also not a good idea to mix Winamp emulation modules as this module will
simply find the top level Winamp window and use that.


General Settings:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*AlbumArt (STRING) [...]
- Creates a number of AlbumArt groups. If no other groups are specified a group
  named "AlbumArt" will be created.

AlbumArtUpdateFrequency (INT)
- How often, in milliseconds, to check if the current song has changed

Group Settings:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(group)ParsePath (STRING)
- Path where AlbumArt should save a copy of the current artwork if it was
  extracted from an ID3 tag. Omitting this setting will prevent AlbumArt from
  scanning ID3 tags for cover art. If a relative path is given, the picture 
  will be saved in $LSImageFolder$.
  Default: ""

  Possible values: Other, PNG32Icon, OtherIcon, CoverFront, CoverBack, 
  LeafletPage, Media, LeadArtist, Artist, Conductor, Band, Composer, Lyricist, 
  RecordingLocation, Recording, Performance, Video, Fish, Illustration,
  ArtistLogo, and PublisherLogo. Any invalid values will be considered as 
  "CoverFront".

(group)NoArtPath (STRING)
- Path to a picture that should be used if no cover art is found. If a
  relative path is given, it is assumed to reside in $LSImageFolder$.
  Default: ""

*(group)CoverName (STRING) [...]
- Filenames, in order of priority, that the module should search for in the
  folder of the currently playing song. You can use * and ? as  wildcards.
  * matches any characters (0 or more) and ? matches any single character. 
  
(group)NoCRC (BOOL)
- If this is set to true AlbumArt will execute OnAlbumArtChanged.
  Default: False
  
(group)TrackOffset (INTEGER)
- Offset from the current track to get albumart for (1 = next track, -1 =
  previous track).
  Default: 0

  relative path is given, it is assumed to reside in $LSImageFolder$.

- Set to true to search for covers in the folder before searching through the
  tag.
  Default: False

(group)AutoDownloadCoversTo (STRING)
- If this is set AlbumArt will automatically attempt to download covers from
  www.albumart.org when it can't find any albumart in other ways. Paths are
  relative to the folder of the current song.
  Default: ""


Group Evars:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(group)Path
- The path to the current album art.

(group)IsOutOfBounds
- True when the track for the group is outside the playlist (this will only
  happen with (group)TrackOffset set), false otherwise.
  
(group)CRC
- The CRC of the current album cover if (group)NoCRC is false, "" otherwise.
